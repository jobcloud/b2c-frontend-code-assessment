# Task 3: Testing Concept
Take a look at `SomeComponent.tsx` in the task folder and prepare a testing concept answering the following question:

1. What type(s) of tests do you think appropriate to test this component (or parts of it) and what testing libraries would you use?
2. What assertions would you make?
3. What challenges do you foresee, respectively, can you think of changes to the code that would increase "testability"?
4. What other forms of testing/quality assurance do you expect in a big project?

Where relevant, provide code snippets (references, changes requests, additions).
