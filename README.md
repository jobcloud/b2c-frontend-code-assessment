# JobCloud B2C
## Frontend Code Assessment

Your coding assessment consists of three parts:

- Task 1: [Code Review](task_1/README.md)
- Task 2: [Testing Concept](task_2/README.md)
- Task 3: [Coding Exercise](task_3/README.md)

In every folder you will find a dedicated README.md with the specific task. The tasks can be done in the order you prefer,
they do not depend on each other.

## Constraints

- this assessment has been designed to be solved within 4-6 hours
- it's up to you to goldplate if you like
- your answers need to be in a txt, md, tsx, ts or js file
- you will provide your solution as a zip (zip the folder) as an email attachment
- you will send the archive to norman.wehrle@jobcloud.ch 
- be prepared to have a small presentation (15min) about your solution
- the presentation will be a starting point for a technical discussion

Good Luck!
