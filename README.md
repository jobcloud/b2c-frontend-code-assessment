# JobCloud B2C

Oh God, a test like in school! Please don't lose your courage. The tasks include topics that are important to us. Even if you don't solve everything one hundred percent, it helps us to understand what makes you tick. You would solve something differently if you had more time? Mention it. You have lost a lot of time on a certain topic. Mention it. Solving the tasks gives us a starting point to get into the technical conversation. Even if you only have answers to part of the exercises, you are still in the race!

## Frontend Code Assessment

Your coding assessment consists of three parts:

- Task 1: [Code Review](task_1/README.md)
- Task 2: [Testing Concept](task_2/README.md)
- Task 3: [Coding Exercise](task_3/README.md)

In every folder you will find a dedicated README.md with the specific task. The tasks can be done in the order you prefer,
they do not depend on each other.

## Constraints

- this assessment has been designed to be solved within 4-6 hours
- it's up to you to goldplate if you like
- your answers need to be in a txt, md, tsx, ts or js file
- you will provide your solution as a zip (zip the folder) as an email attachment
- you will send the archive to norman.wehrle@jobcloud.ch 
- be prepared to have a small presentation (15min) about your solution
- the presentation will be a starting point for a technical discussion

Good Luck!
